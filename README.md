# Analysis of Green Energy Stocks

### **Overview of Project** 
The project analyses stock price data of fifteen green energy stocks for 2017 and 2018 to calculate the annual returns based on the daily stock closing price.  

### **Purpose**
The purpose of this analysis is to calculate and categorize the yearly return of stock prices of companies associated with renewable energy and green technology. The analysis results will help inform investors on the performance of the stock and whether it has a positive or negative return for a given year. 

### **Results**
#### 2017 Stock Analysis Results
The results of the VBA run are shown below. Based on the table we can see that almost all of the stocks were in the green for 2017 with only "TERP" showing a net loss of -7.2%. The top-performing stocks for the year were "DQ", "SEDG", "ENPH" and "FSLR" respectively, with DQ almost doubling in price by the end of the year. It seems that this year was generally a good one for sustainable energy stocks and anybody invested in the stocks listed below except for "TERP" would have seen a positive return on investment.

### **Summary : Code Refactoring**
Code Refactoring is a way of restructuring and optimizing already written code to improve its flow, readability, and execution.
- #### Advantages of Refactoring the code:
    - The code is easy to understand and follow for others collaborating on the project. 
    - Refactoring the code helps in optimizing the performance of the code. 
    - The code is easier to debug and troubleshoot and isolate code smells. 
  
- #### Disadvantages of Refactoring the code:
    - Commenting and editing the code takes additional time and effort. 
    - If the project is on a tight schedule and budget, code refactoring can be expensive. 
    - Sometimes code refactoring can lead to additional bugs if the coder is not familiar with the code in the first place. 
    - Refactoring is more for people working on the code directly and does not matter to management so it might lead to budget and timeline issues.
